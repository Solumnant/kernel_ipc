tested encrypt function seperately in userspace and it worked. it isn't a syscall so it's been guarded

tested add, remove, and both counts with and without sudo to ensure correct behavior

used fork to test good behavior with locking

I probably spent more time reading and rereading my functions at different implementation stages than I did testing: I read and reread all non-trivial functions at least 6-7 times for logic while they were in userspace, and I made sure I changed all functions properly.
